passagemath: General purpose mathematical software system, a fork of SageMath
=============================================================================

[passagemath](https://github.com/passagemath/passagemath) is open source mathematical
software in Python, released under the GNU General Public Licence GPLv2+.

It is a fork of [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/), which has been developed 2005-2025
under the motto "Creating a Viable Open Source Alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica,
and MATLAB".

The passagemath fork was created in October 2024 with the following goals:

* providing modularized installation with pip, thus completing a [major project started in 2020 in the Sage codebase](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/29705),
* establishing first-class membership in the scientific Python ecosystem,
* giving [clear attribution of upstream projects](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/6HO1HEtL1Fs/m/G002rPGpAAAJ),
* providing independently usable Python interfaces to upstream libraries,
* providing [platform portability and integration testing services](https://github.com/passagemath/passagemath/issues/704) to upstream projects,
* inviting collaborations with upstream projects,
* [building a professional, respectful, inclusive community](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/xBzaINHWwUQ),
* developing a port to [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) for serverless deployment with Javascript,
* developing a native Windows port.

[Full documentation](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/index.html) is available online.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

passagemath attempts to support and provides binary wheels suitable for
all major Linux distributions and recent versions of macOS.
Binary wheels for native Windows (x86_64) are gradually made available in the passagemath
10.6.x series. Use of the full functionality on Windows currently requires the use of Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or virtualization.

can be found in the
[release notes](https://github.com/passagemath/passagemath/releases).


Full installation of passagemath from binary wheels on PyPI
-----------------------------------------------------------

passagemath attempts to support all major Linux distributions and recent versions of
macOS. Use on Windows currently requires the use of Windows Subsystem for Linux or
virtualization.

Complete sets of binary wheels are provided on PyPI for Python versions 3.9.x-3.13.x
for Linux and macOS, both for the x86_64 and ARM architectures.

Unless you need to install passagemath into a specific existing environment, we recommend
to create and activate a fresh virtual environment over a suitable Python (3.9.x-3.13.x),
for example `~/passagemath-venv/`:

    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.12.7
    $ python3 -m venv ~/passagemath-venv
    $ source ~/passagemath-venv/bin/activate

For Python 3.13.x on any platform, and for any Python version on the Linux aarch64 (ARM)
and macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3/M4) platforms,
[some third-party packages are still missing wheels](https://github.com/passagemath/passagemath/issues/347).
Build these wheels from source using [![PyPI: passagemath-conf](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/passagemath-conf.svg?label=passagemath-conf)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/passagemath-conf)

```bash session
(passagemath-venv) $ export SAGE_CONF_TARGETS="gmpy2 memory_allocator"
(passagemath-venv) $ export SAGE_CONF_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--disable-gcc-version-check"
(passagemath-venv) $ pip install --force-reinstall -v passagemath-conf
(passagemath-venv) $ export PIP_FIND_LINKS=$(sage-config SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS)
(passagemath-venv) $ export PIP_PREFER_BINARY=1
```

Then install the meta-package [![PyPI: passagemath-standard](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/passagemath-standard.svg?label=passagemath-standard)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/passagemath-standard)

    (passagemath-venv) $ pip install -v --prefer-binary passagemath-standard

Start the Sage REPL:

    (passagemath-venv) $ sage

Alternatively, use a Python or IPython REPL, or use a Python or Sage kernel in Jupyter.


Modularized distributions
-------------------------

As the installation using pip shows, passagemath provides the Sage library in a large number of distributions (pip-installable packages) that can also be installed separately.

Authors of packages that depend on the Sage library can declare dependencies on these distributions. The benefit for users of the package: There is no longer a need to first install Sage. Instead, the parts of the Sage library that are needed by the package are automatically installed. Thus, the package becomes a first-class member of the Python ecosystem.

- [sage-numerical-interactive-mip](https://github.com/passagemath/sage-numerical-interactive-mip) is an example of a pure Python package that [declares dependencies](https://github.com/passagemath/sage-numerical-interactive-mip/blob/master/pyproject.toml) on four distributions: passagemath-polyhedra, passagemath-plot, passagemath-repl, and passagemath-flint.
- [kerrgeodesic_gw](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/kerrgeodesic_gw) is an example of a pure Python package that [declares optional dependencies ("extras-require")](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/kerrgeodesic_gw/blob/master/setup.py#L49) on three distributions: passagemath-symbolics, passagemath-plot, and passagemath-repl.

- See https://github.com/passagemath/passagemath/issues/248 for many more examples how to change a user package to make it ready for passagemath and the Python ecosystem.

Here is an overview of the distribution packages of passagemath.

### Distributions named after a basic mathematical structure

The packages may also cover a wide range of generalizations/applications of the structure after which they are named. Users who work in a specialized research area will, of course, recognize what structures they need. The down-to-earth naming also creates discoverability by a broader audience.

### Distributions named after a third-party non-Python dependency

This makes technical sense because the dependencies will be localized to this distribution package, but it also helps give **attribution and visibility** to these libraries and projects that Sage depends on.

### Distributions named after a technical functionality

[![PyPI: passagemath-objects](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/passagemath-objects.svg?label=passagemath-objects)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/passagemath-objects) Sage extends Python's object system by dynamic   mix-in classes that are driven by categories and axioms. It is loosely   modeled on concepts of category theory and inspired by   Scratchpad/Axiom/FriCAS, Magma, and MuPAD. This distribution package makes Sage objects, the element/parent framework, basic categories and functors,   the coercion system and the related metaclasses available. It only depends on the basic arithmetic libraries [GMP](http://gmplib.org), [MPFR](http://mpfr.org/), [MPC](https://www.multiprecision.org/mpc), on the Cython interface [gmpy2](https://pypi.org/project/gmpy2/) to these libraries, and on  [cysignals](https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals).

[![PyPI: passagemath-categories](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/passagemath-categories.svg?label=passagemath-categories)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/passagemath-categories) This distribution package contains the full set of categories defined by Sage, as well as basic mathematical objects such as integers and rational numbers, a basic implementation of polynomials, and affine spaces.  None of this brings in additional dependencies.

[![PyPI: passagemath-environment](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/passagemath-environment.svg?label=passagemath-environment)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/passagemath-environment) provides the `sage` script for launching the Sage REPL and accessing various developer tools and Python modules that provide the connection to the system and software environment.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

passagemath attempts to support all major Linux distributions and recent versions of
macOS. Use on Windows currently requires the use of Windows Subsystem for Linux or
virtualization.

Detailed information on supported platforms for a specific version of Sage
can be found in the section _Availability and installation help_ of the
[release notes for this version](https://github.com/passagemath/passagemath/releases).

We highly appreciate contributions to passagemath that fix portability bugs
and help port Sage to new platforms.

[Windows] Preparing the Platform
--------------------------------

The preferred way to run Sage on Windows is using Windows Subsystem for
Linux (WSL). Follow the
[official WSL setup guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq)
to install Ubuntu (or another Linux distribution).
Make sure you allocate WSL sufficient RAM; 5GB is known to work, while
2GB might be not enough for building Sage from source.
Then all instructions for installation in Linux apply.

As an alternative, you can also run Linux on Windows using Docker
or other virtualization solutions.

[macOS] Preparing the Platform
------------------------------

- If your Mac uses the Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4; arm64) architecture and
  you set up your Mac by transferring files from an older Mac, make sure
  that the directory ``/usr/local`` does not contain an old copy of Homebrew
  (or other software) for the x86_64 architecture that you may have copied
  over.  Note that Homebrew for Apple Silicon is installed in ``/opt/homebrew``,
  not ``/usr/local``.

- We strongly recommend to use Homebrew ("the missing package
  manager for macOS") from https://brew.sh/, which provides the ``gfortran``
  compiler and many libraries.

- Otherwise, if you do not wish to install Homebrew, you will need to install
  the latest version of Xcode Command Line Tools.  Open a terminal window and
  run `xcode-select --install`; then click "Install" in the pop-up window.  If
  the Xcode Command Line Tools are already installed, you may want to check if
  they need to be updated by typing `softwareupdate -l`.

Preparation for Building from Source
------------------------------------

The instructions cover all of Linux, macOS, and WSL.

More details, providing a background for these instructions, can be found
in the section [Install from Source Code](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html)
in the Installation Guide.


1.  Decide on the source/build directory (`SAGE_ROOT`):

    - Any subdirectory of your :envvar:`HOME` directory should do.

    - For example, you could use `SAGE_ROOT=~/sage/passagemath`, which we
      will use as the running example below.

    - You need at least 10 GB of free disk space.

    - The full path to the source directory must contain **no spaces**.

    - After starting the build, you cannot move the source/build
      directory without breaking things.

    - You may want to avoid slow filesystems such as
      [network file systems (NFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System)
      and the like.

    - [macOS] macOS allows changing directories without using exact capitalization.
      Beware of this convenience when compiling for macOS. Ignoring exact
      capitalization when changing into :envvar:`SAGE_ROOT` can lead to build
      errors for dependencies requiring exact capitalization in path names.

2.  Clone the sources with `git`:

    - To check that `git` is available, open a terminal and enter
      the following command at the shell prompt (`$`):

            $ git --version
            git version 2.42.0

      The exact version does not matter, but if this command gives an error,
      install `git` using your package manager, using one of these commands:

            $ sudo pacman -S git                          # on Arch Linux
            $ sudo apt-get update && apt-get install git  # on Debian/Ubuntu
            $ sudo yum install git                        # on Fedora/Redhat/CentOS
            $ sudo zypper install git                     # on openSUSE
            $ sudo xbps-install git                       # on Void Linux

    - Create the directory where `SAGE_ROOT` should be established:

            $ mkdir -p ~/sage
            $ cd ~/sage

    - Clone the passagemath git repository:

            $ git clone -c core.symlinks=true --filter blob:none  \
                        --origin passagemath \
                        https://github.com/passagemath/passagemath.git

      This will create the subdirectory `~/sage/passagemath`. (See the section
      [Setting up git](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_setup.html)
      and the following sections in the Sage Developer's Guide
      for more information.)

    - Change into the created subdirectory:

            $ cd passagemath

    - [Windows] The passagemath source tree contains symbolic links, and the
      build will not work if Windows line endings rather than UNIX
      line endings are used.

      Therefore it is recommended (but not necessary) to use the
      WSL version of `git`.

3.  Install system packages.

    Either refer for this to the [section on installation from
    source](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html) in the
    Sage Installation Manual for compilations of system packages
    that you can install.

    The precise list of packages varies with the version of your
    distribution. If a package is not available and gives an error, just skip it
    and try again with the rest of the packages.

    When done, skip to step 7 (bootstrapping).

    Alternatively, follow the more fine-grained approach below.

4.  [Linux, WSL] Install the required minimal build prerequisites:

    - Compilers: `gcc`, `gfortran`, `g++` (GCC versions from 9.x to 14.x
      and recent versions of Clang (LLVM) are supported).
      See [build/pkgs/gcc/SPKG.rst](build/pkgs/gcc/SPKG.rst) and
      [build/pkgs/gfortran/SPKG.rst](build/pkgs/gfortran/SPKG.rst)
      for a discussion of suitable compilers.

    - Build tools: GNU `make`, GNU `m4`, `perl` (including
      `ExtUtils::MakeMaker`), `ranlib`, `git`, `tar`, `bc`.
      See [build/pkgs/_prereq/SPKG.rst](build/pkgs/_prereq/SPKG.rst) for
      more details.

    - Python 3.4 or later, or Python 2.7, a full installation including
      `urllib`; but ideally version 3.9.x-3.13.x, which
      will avoid having to build Sage's own copy of Python 3.
      See [build/pkgs/python3/SPKG.rst](build/pkgs/python3/SPKG.rst)
      for more details.

    We have collected lists of system packages that provide these build
    prerequisites. See, in the folder
    [build/pkgs/_prereq/distros](build/pkgs/_prereq/distros),
    the files
    [arch.txt](build/pkgs/_prereq/distros/arch.txt),
    [debian.txt](build/pkgs/_prereq/distros/debian.txt)
    (also for Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.),
    [fedora.txt](build/pkgs/_prereq/distros/fedora.txt)
    (also for Red Hat, CentOS),
    [opensuse.txt](build/pkgs/_prereq/distros/opensuse.txt),
    [slackware.txt](build/pkgs/_prereq/distros/slackware.txt), and
    [void.txt](build/pkgs/_prereq/distros/void.txt), or visit
    https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/_prereq.html#spkg-prereq

5.  Optional: It is recommended that you have both LaTeX and
    the ImageMagick tools (e.g. the "convert" command) installed
    since some plotting functionality benefits from them.

6.  Install the bootstrapping prerequisites. See the files in the folder
    [build/pkgs/_bootstrap/distros](build/pkgs/_bootstrap/distros), or
    visit
    https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/_bootstrap.html#spkg-bootstrap

7.  Sanitize the build environment. Use the command

        $ env

    to inspect the current environment variables, in particular `PATH`,
    `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `CFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`,
    and `LDFLAGS` (if set).

    Remove items from these (colon-separated) environment variables
    that Sage should not use for its own build. In particular, remove
    items if they refer to a previous Sage installation.

    - [WSL] In particular, WSL imports many items from the Windows
      `PATH` variable into the Linux environment, which can lead to
      confusing build errors. These items typically start with `/mnt/c`.
      It is best to remove all of them from the environment variables.
      For example, you can set `PATH` using the command:

            $ export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/lib/wsl/lib

    - [macOS with homebrew] Set required environment variables for the build:

            $ source ./.homebrew-build-env

      This is to make some of Homebrew's packages (so-called keg-only
      packages) available for the build. Run it once to apply the
      suggestions for the current terminal session. You may need to
      repeat this command before you rebuild Sage from a new terminal
      session, or after installing additional homebrew packages.  (You
      can also add it to your shell profile so that it gets run
      automatically in all future sessions.)

8.  Bootstrap the source tree using the following command:

        $ make configure

Full Installation from Source as passagemath
--------------------------------------------

Unless you need to install passagemath into a specific existing environment, we recommend
to create and activate a fresh virtual environment over a suitable Python (3.9.x-3.13.x),
for example `~/passagemath-venv/`:

    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.12.7
    $ python3 -m venv ~/passagemath-venv
    $ source ~/passagemath-venv/bin/activate

Next, if you want to build from PyPI, use the following command:

    (passagemath-venv) $ export SAGE_CONF_TARGETS=build

If you want to build from a local clone of the passagemath repository instead,
use the following command first.

    (passagemath-venv) $ export SAGE_ROOT=$(pwd)
    (passagemath-venv) $ export PIP_CONSTRAINT="$(pwd)/constraints_pkgs.txt"
    (passagemath-venv) $ export SAGE_CONF_TARGETS=build-local

As the first installation step, install [![PyPI: passagemath-conf](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/passagemath-conf.svg?label=passagemath-conf)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/passagemath-conf),
which builds various prerequisite non-Python packages in a subdirectory of `~/.sage/`.
The build can be customized by setting `SAGE_CONF_CONFIGURE_ARGS`.

    (passagemath-venv) $ python3 -m pip install -v passagemath-conf

After a successful installation, a wheelhouse provides various Python packages.
You can list the wheels using the command:

    (passagemath-venv) $ ls $(sage-config SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS)

If this gives an error saying that `sage-config` is not found, check any messages
that the `pip install` command may have printed. You may need to adjust your `PATH`,
for example by:

    (passagemath-venv) $ export PATH="$(python3 -c 'import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_path("scripts", "posix_user"))'):$PATH"
    (passagemath-venv) $ ls $(sage-config SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS)

Now arrange for the packages from the wheelhouse to be picked up:

    (passagemath-venv) $ export PIP_FIND_LINKS=$(sage-config SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS)
    (passagemath-venv) $ export PIP_PREFER_BINARY=1

Next, install the [![PyPI: passagemath-setup](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/passagemath-setup.svg?label=passagemath-setup)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/passagemath-setup) package:

    (passagemath-venv) $ python3 -m pip install "passagemath-setup[autogen]"

Finally, install the Sage library from the package [![PyPI: passagemath-standard](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/passagemath-standard.svg?label=passagemath-standard)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/passagemath-standard):

    (passagemath-venv) $ python3 -m pip install --no-build-isolation -v passagemath-standard

The above instructions install the latest stable release of passagemath.
To install the latest development version instead, add the switch `--pre` to all invocations of
`python3 -m pip install`.

Traditional Installation from Source as Sage-the-Distribution
-------------------------------------------------------------

9.  Optionally, decide on the installation prefix (`SAGE_LOCAL`):

    - Traditionally, and by default, Sage is installed into the
      subdirectory hierarchy rooted at `SAGE_ROOT/local/`.

    - This can be changed using `./configure --prefix=SAGE_LOCAL`,
      where `SAGE_LOCAL` is the desired installation prefix, which
      must be writable by the user.

      Unless you use this option in combination with `--enable-editable`,
      you can delete the entire Sage source tree after completing
      the build process.  What is installed in `SAGE_LOCAL` will be
      a self-contained installation of Sage.

    - Note that in Sage's build process, `make` builds **and**
      installs (`make install` is a no-op).  Therefore the
      installation hierarchy must be writable by the user.

    - See the Sage Installation Manual for options if you want to
      install into shared locations such as `/usr/local/`.
      Do not attempt to build Sage as `root`.

10. Optionally, review the configuration options, which includes
    many optional packages:

        $ ./configure --help

    Notable options for Sage developers are the following:

    - Use the option `--config-cache` to have `configure`
      keep a disk cache of configuration values. This gives a nice speedup
      when trying out ticket branches that make package upgrades, which
      involves automatic re-runs of the configuration step.

    - Use the option `--enable-ccache` to have Sage install and use the
      optional package `ccache`, which is preconfigured to keep a
      disk cache of object files created from source files. This can give
      a great speedup when switching between different branches, at the
      expense of disk space use.

11. Optional, but highly recommended: Set some environment variables to
    customize the build.

    For example, the `MAKE` environment variable controls whether to
    run several jobs in parallel.  On a machine with 4 processors, say,
    typing `export MAKE="make -j4"` will configure the build script to
    perform a parallel compilation of Sage using 4 jobs. On some
    powerful machines, you might even consider `-j16`, as building with
    more jobs than CPU cores can speed things up further.

    To reduce the terminal output during the build, type `export V=0`.
    (`V` stands for "verbosity".)

    Some environment variables deserve a special mention: `CC`,
    `CXX` and `FC`. These variables defining your compilers
    can be set at configuration time and their values will be recorded for
    further use at build time and runtime.

    For an in-depth discussion of more environment variables for
    building Sage, see [the installation
    guide](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#environment-variables).

12. Type `./configure`, followed by any options that you wish to use.
    For example, to build Sage with `gf2x` package supplied by Sage,
    use `./configure --with-system-gf2x=no`.

    At the end of a successful `./configure` run, you may see messages
    recommending to install extra system packages using your package
    manager.

    For a large [list of Sage
    packages](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/27330), Sage is able to
    detect whether an installed system package is suitable for use with
    Sage; in that case, Sage will not build another copy from source.

    Sometimes, the messages will recommend to install packages that are
    already installed on your system. See the earlier configure
    messages or the file `config.log` for explanation.  Also, the
    messages may recommend to install packages that are actually not
    available; only the most recent releases of your distribution will
    have all of these recommended packages.

13. Optional: If you choose to install the additional system packages,
    a re-run of `./configure` will test whether the versions installed
    are usable for Sage; if they are, this will reduce the compilation
    time and disk space needed by Sage. The usage of packages may be
    adjusted by `./configure` parameters (check again the output of
    `./configure --help`).

14. Type `make build`.  That's it! Everything is automatic and
    non-interactive.

    If you followed the above instructions, in particular regarding the
    installation of system packages recommended by the output of
    `./configure` (step 10), and regarding the parallel build (step 11),
    building Sage takes less than one hour on a modern computer.
    (Otherwise, it can take much longer.)

    The build should work fine on all fully supported platforms. If it
    does not, we want to know!

15. Type `./sage` to try it out. In Sage, try for example `2 + 2`,
    `plot(x^2)`, `plot3d(lambda x, y: x*y, (-1, 1), (-1, 1))`
    to test a simple computation and plotting in 2D and 3D.
    Type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> or `quit` to quit Sage.

16. Optional: Type `make ptestlong` to test all examples in the documentation
    (over 200,000 lines of input!) -- this takes from 10 minutes to
    several hours. Don't get too disturbed if there are 2 to 3 failures,
    but always feel free to email the section of `logs/ptestlong.log` that
    contains errors to the [sage-support mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-support).
    If there are numerous failures, there was a serious problem with your build.

17. Optional: If you want to build a local HTML version of the
    [documentation](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/index.html), run
    `make doc-html`. After a successful build, it resides in the directory
    `local/share/doc/sage/html/`. You may want to bookmark it in your browser.

18. Optional: If you want to build the PDF version of the documentation,
    run `make doc-pdf` (this requires LaTeX to be installed).

19. Optional: Install optional packages of interest to you:
    get a list by typing  `./sage --optional` or by visiting the
    [packages documentation page](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/).

20. Optional: Create a symlink to the installed `sage` script in a
    directory in your `PATH`, for example `/usr/local/bin/`. This will
    allow you to start Sage by typing `sage` from anywhere rather than
    having to either type the full path or navigate to the Sage
    directory and type `./sage`. This can be done by running:

        $ sudo ln -s $(./sage -sh -c 'ls $SAGE_ROOT/venv/bin/sage') /usr/local/bin

Use With an Existing Jupyter Installation
-----------------------------------------

21. Optional: Set up SageMath as a Jupyter kernel in an existing Jupyter notebook
    or JupyterLab installation, as described in the section
    [Launching SageMath](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/launching.html)
    in the Sage Installation Guide.
